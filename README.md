#Purpose_Points

Purpose points are minted when a cryptocurrency of calculatable economic value is added to the Purpose basket creating a 
cryptocurrency balance sheet. The algorithum to determine how many purpose points are minted for a coin of value, is to 
determine the market value of the use case in its equavilent average market value in calories. Food being the most neccesary 
asset for human survival on average has a stable price whereas determining this number given a government issued currency's 
value, would cause the number to increase continually.

#Problem

Financial experts have stated they were more likely to purchase a coin of calculatable economic value. These coins however, are 
meant to be used for the purpose they're minted for, and it is required to swap between them for each purpose. Purpose Points 
enable these assets to be in one place as a currency and are burned when the underlying asset is removed from the basket.

#Governance

This approach requires a council of economic experts to determine which cryptocurrencies are assets of calculatable economic 
value and to set the price of these assets. Given that person's in power tend to abuse power, council members will be hot 
swappable using liquid democratic voting.
